The script should allow the user to: 1. Input an opponent's name, player jersey numbers, and names. The script should create a new sheet named after the opponent or use an existing one if the first sheet is already used. Player jersey numbers should be placed starting from the second cell in the first row, and names starting from the second cell in the second row. Input for this part ends when the user enters '0'. 2. Initialize all player scores to 0 at the beginning. Record player scores by game set. The user inputs a player's jersey number, and their score for the current set is incremented by 1. 3. When the user enters 'done', the script should ask if they want to continue to the next set. If yes, a new row for the next set is prepared. 4. When the user enters 'fin', the script should calculate the total score for each player and output the results in a table in the next row."

        "The previous step successfully refactored the Google Sheet interaction functions and removed Gradio-specific code. However, the authentication failed because the service account key file was not found, as expected in this environment. The current subtask is to adapt the code structure for Streamlit, which implies the next logical step is to set up how Streamlit will handle Google Sheets authentication, likely using `st.secrets`. Although the full Streamlit app structure is not built yet, defining how the client and sheet objects will be obtained in a Streamlit context is necessary for the subsequent steps. I will create a function or a pattern for obtaining the authenticated `client` and `sheet` objects, keeping in mind Streamlit's execution model. Since the exact `st.secrets` key name for the service account will be needed, and I should not assume it, I will add a placeholder/comment indicating where the secrets reading should occur.\n",
